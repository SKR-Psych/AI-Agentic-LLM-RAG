# Agentic LLM Core ðŸ§ 

An experimental Pythonâ€“Rust hybrid framework for building modular, autonomous agents using reasoning-first design principles.

> Developed by a rotating group of contributors investigating the capabilities, limitations, and coordination strategies of large language models in open environments.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Features

- Agentic core in Python for prompt-based reasoning
- Lightweight Rust backend for fast memory primitives
- CLI for prompt-based reasoning
- Modular system (tools & agents) that evolves over time
- Daily continuous improvements and benchmarking
- Jupyter notebooks for internal testing and experimentation
- Semantic versioning and changelog maintained in-repo

---

## âš¡ Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SKR-Psych/AI-Agentic-LLM-RAG.git
cd AI-Agentic-LLM-RAG
python cli.py --prompt "What role does memory play in long-term agency?"

# Example usage:
python cli.py --prompt "How should autonomous agents manage ethical decisions?"
```
---
## ðŸ§  Philosophy

This is a minimalist research-oriented project exploring how:

modular memory,

reasoning loops,

and environmental awareness

can be embedded in autonomous systems, even without full-stack simulation environments or costly orchestration layers.

## ðŸ§¾ Notebooks

See /notebooks/ for internal tests of reasoning flow and thought-chaining.
---
## ðŸ“Š Benchmarks

Performance traces and tests are located in /benchmarks/.
